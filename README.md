A compact and simple Python code for topology optimization using hexagonal elements. The symmetric MBB beam is the default design domain in the HoneyTop90.m code. The other extensions are also mentioned in the paper. The other extensions are also mentioned in the paper [PyHexTop: a compact Python code for topology optimization using hexagonal elements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01968)). The paper is presented in NCMDAO 2023 conference
